Affylite - Easy Affiliate Disclosure and Disclaimer

== Description ==
Add a simple affiliate disclosure and disclaimer to the top of each post. Easy, lite, and no bloat. Under 5kb.

Set your own custom message using the admin page. Use at your own risk/reward. Seek legal counsel for appropriate disclosure and dislaimer messages. This is a template plugin, so feel free to slice, dice, and diy.
